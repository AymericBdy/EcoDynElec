EcoDynElec: Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment of electricity for ENTSO-E countries
==============================================================================

EcoDynElec software tracks the origin of electricity accross european countries based on generation and cross-border exchanges and allows the dynamic evaluation of environmental impacts of electricity.

``ecodynelec`` is a free software under APACHE 2.0 licence. It was developped in a collaboration between the `EMPA <https://www.empa.ch/>`_, `HEIG-VD <https://heig-vd.ch/>`_, the `SUPSI <https://www.supsi.ch/home.html>`_.

Installation
============
For now the software can only be installed from the `gitlab repository <https://gitlab.com/fledee/ecodynelec/>`_

Contributions
=============
EcoDynElec did contribute to the project `EcoDynBat - Ecobilan Dynamique des BÃ¢timents <https://www.aramis.admin.ch/Texte/?ProjectID=41804>`_.

Renaming the whold directory
============================
We are going to need a complete renaming, as ``ecodynelec`` is not satisfying at all.
This means different things, as explained in `this post <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2041993/how-do-i-rename-a-git-repository>`_


There are various possible interpretations of what is meant by renaming a Git repository: the displayed name, the repository directory, or the remote repository name. Each requires different steps to rename.

Displayed Name
**************

Rename the displayed name (for example, shown by `gitweb`):

    - Edit ``.git/description`` to contain the repository's name.
    - Save the file.

Repository Directory
********************

Git does not reference the name of the directory containing the repository, as used by git clone master child, so we can simply rename it:

    - Open a command prompt (or file manager window).
    - Change to the directory that contains the repository directory (i.e., do not go into the repository directory itself).
    - Rename the directory (for example, using `mv` from the command line or the `F2` hotkey from a GUI).

Remote Repository
*****************

Rename a remote repository as follows:

    - Go to the remote host (for example, https://github.com/User/project).
    - Follow the host's instructions to rename the project (will differ from host to host, but usually Settings is a good starting point).
    - Go to your local repository directory (i.e., open a command prompt and change to the repository's directory).
    - Determine the new URL (for example, git@github.com:User/project-new.git)
    - Set the new URL using Git:

.. code-block::

    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:User/project-new.git
