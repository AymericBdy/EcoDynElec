Algorithms of Dynamical
=======================

`dynamical` is a collection of functions shaped into a package.
Though it can be used as a software and simply piloted with a few
parameters and the main function.

This section of the documentation decomposes each block and functionality
achieveable with `dynamical` and explains what more elementary bolcks of
code it relies on.

Hopefully this will help future developers identifying possible improvements
to make the software grow, always in an open-source spirit!
